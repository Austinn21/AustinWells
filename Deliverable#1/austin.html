        <h2>Education Background</h2>
        <p>I graduated from Saint Clair High School in 2014. I then left in August of 2014 to join the Army which I completed Basic Training in January of 2015. 
            My first duty situation was South Korea where I had the opportunity to go to SRT (Special Reaction Training) school. While there I also completed phase 2, 
            which is a marksmanship course. After that I was placed on the team in South Korea. In January 2016 I was stationed back in the states at Fort Riley and 
            completed their Law Enforcement course and patrolled from 2016-2019.During my time there I had the opportunity to go to BLC (Basic Leaders Course) which is where they "teach" 
            you to be a leader, it is required to be promoted to Seargent. In 2019 I was honorably discharged from the Army and enrolled in Metropolitan Community College 
            and took courses to achieve my associate degree in computer science which I completed in the Fall of 2023. I then transferred to UMKC to complete my Bachelors 
            in that same field. I am set to graduate in the fall of 2024.
